## Why a 3D printer?
I have a lot of ideas that I want to materialize. 3d printer is the perfect tool to rapidly prototype your ideas and convert a virtual digital design into a real one. The best part is that the complexity of the part has no effect on the 3d printing process and therefore gives you the freedom to design with an open mind.

A bigger objective is that I want to make a system where the printed objects have a small robot-like things in them that can crawl freely inside the object. The object will act like a living thing where it can repair itself and change its shape with a digital update. The robots will act like a small 3d printer that can melt plastic from somewhere and print plastic somewhere else.

## Next Steps
Now that I have a working printer, I can use it to print parts to improve it. The timing belt and the z-axis need the most attention. The motors that I used on this machine are also very cheap and slow, So I will change them with some more powerful ones.

Thank you and see you in the next blog post.
